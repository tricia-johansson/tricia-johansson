- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tricia Johansson but online I go by the name Trix Joyce in most places.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, graphic design, and illustration. I'm especially interested in web development and building web apps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and PHP but also refreshing my CSS skills.
- ðŸ“« If you want to contact me, please use the contact form here: http://trixjoyce.com/contact
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to work with coding and graphic design but it was like 10 years ago. Now I'm working on re-learning my skills.
